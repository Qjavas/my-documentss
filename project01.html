            <h2>Introduction to Backend Development</h2>
            <p>
              You all undoubtedly use social networking apps. It puts the
              relevant data on your screen whenever you tap on a video while
              scrolling through your feed or maybe do a search. The user
              experience offered by these programs is outstanding, right? But
              how is it done? The answer is the backend language of the
              application. Backend languages contribute to the smooth user
              experience, and it's the fundamental language leveraged while
              creating durable backend systems. There are several languages and
              frameworks used in backend development. These backend development
              languages make it easier to build reliable systems for web
              applications easier. This article highlights the 10 best backend
              languages deployed by developers worldwide.
            </p>
            <h2>What are Backend Languages?</h2>
            <p>
              Backend languages are coding languages programmers use to develop
              internal architecture and systems capable of running any web
              application’s background operations. Backend programming languages
              offer certain features that make it simpler for the software users
              to send and/or receive information and data from the server. When
              handling an application, these backend languages are put in charge
              of obtaining data from the database containing the stored
              information. In this article, we’re providing you with a list of
              top 10 backend languages that you must consider learning before
              you get started with web development:
            </p>
            <h2>Top-Backend Languages</h2>
          </div>

          <div class="list">
            <ol start="1">
              <div class="java">
                <li><h3>Java</h3></li>
              <p>
                Java, one of the best <a href="#######">OOP</a> s, has multithreading that enables programmers to run two or more threads simultaneously to enhance <a href="#####" style="color: darkcyan;">CPU</a> efficiency. Programmers use this backend language to build scientific, desktop, android apps, enterprise-scale online applications, and other app types. 
                Also, Java, ranking on top of our list of the best backend language, comes with plenty of other benefits, like: 
                <ul>
                    <li>Adherence to all OOP concepts</li>
                    <li>Platform independence </li>
                    <li>Vast open-source libraries</li>
                    <li>Garbage collection, etc</li>
                </ul>
              </p>
              </div>
              <div class="Rubi">
                <li>
                    <h2>Ruby</h2>
                    <p>A huge, engaged community, quick development cycles, and a clear, simple syntax are all features of the dynamically-typed language. Its versatility, assistance with database connectivity, outstanding performance, asynchronous I/O, and concurrency—the ability to run many threads simultaneously—make it a solid backend language. 

                        Since this backend language is object-oriented, you can develop modular, reusable code. Ruby on Rails framework conventions increases the likelihood of swift backend development. With a mature library ecosystem, introducing new features is simple. </p>
                </li>
              </div>
              <div class="SQL">
                <li>
                    <h2>SQL</h2>
                    <p>A computer language called SQL, a structured query language, employs queries, also known as data requests, to obtain information from databases. 

                        You may implement SQL to retrieve crucial server-side data from databases. Then, leverage that subsequent data to execute operations to ensure an application's or program's client-side functions effectively. SQL, one of the best backend languages, is beneficial for retrieving client information or updating corporate databases. 
                        
                        Instead of laying the groundwork for a piece of software's functionality, back-end engineers frequently employ SQL to carry out administrative chores that aid in its operation. </p>
                </li>
              </div>
